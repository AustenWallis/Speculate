Update Version History for Speculate
------------------------------------

--------------------------------
#### To do list (19th June 2023)
--------------------------------
> Update cookbook throughout. 
> Interpolated data in stage 6 switch 3, maybe smoothen noisy data switch 2.
> Log_amp/Log_ls global kernel calculators to estimate for stage 9.
> Dump file for plots to be saved within. 
> Add two functions:
	- One to pull grid point fluxes
	- One to pull the emulator grid point fluxes. 
> Improve the Speculate plotting:
    - Introduce a grid search plotting section. (maybe with stage 8).
    - A plotting function for the emulated spectrum
    - A plotting function for the grid space spectra
    - Issues with normalisation reconstruction between the emulator and grid 
        space. 
> Emulation/grid point comparison between different numbers of PCA components. 
> Image processing edge detection for fast-moving/discontinuous line profiles?


---------------------------------------
####Â 27.06.2023 Latest Updates Pushed
---------------------------------------
> Added usecols and skiprows variable for the kgrid and short_spec_cv_grid.
    - Usecols controls the wavelength data and flux data at a certain 
        inclination angle. Inc angle is changable
    - Skiprows skips the header of the data files for the grid interface to 
        begin reading the data. Fixed for a given grid interface
> Added 'If an emulator file exists, confirm a new emulation training run.'
    To help stop user from accidentally overwriting of trained emulators. 
> Added Log/scaled/linear flux scale switch to change the observational data 
    domain and emulator work in.
> Added default automatic emulator naming system/custom names possible. 
> Clean up of Speculate_dev.py file to pep8 and files.

--------------------------------------------------
#### 26.05.2023 Temporary update - Troubleshooting
--------------------------------------------------
> Adding in new grid interface for short_spec_cv_grid.
> Adding new short_spec_cv_grid data files short_spec_cv_grid.
> Cookbook code updated for new interface. Text is only updated Stage 1 to 4 for 
    troubleshooting GP interpolation misses.
> No longer requires a separate Starfish install. The program is integrated 
    within the Speculate folder. 


-----------------------
#### 25.04.2023 Updates
-----------------------
> Correlation grid points matrix debugging.
> MCMC running to completion (not erroring out). 
> Updated cookbook text.
> Custom Starfish folder for install required (read cookbook instructions)
> Scaling switch semi-implemented for log/scale/linear. Very small effects in 
    outcomes. 'Log' faster but less sensitive.
